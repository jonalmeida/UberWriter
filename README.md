UberWriter
==========

UberWriter (with debian in mind)

Still working on getting UberWriter to work with Python 3 as it was intended to.
Initial build was with the help of Wolf Vollprecht (UberWriter creator).

Instructions:
- python3 bin/uberwriter

Requirements (SEVERELY INCOMPLETE):
- via apt-get:
	`
	sudo apt-get install python3-gi python3-gi-cairo pandoc texlive python3-enchant python3-apt python3-cairo
	`
